This is my first android app that will showcase the current most populair movies.

I am using themoviedb.org API to access the data that I use. To run this code, you need to add a file called "secrets.xml" to the values folder, with the following code inside:
'''
'<resources>'
    '<string name="api_key" type="string">YOUR API CODE HERE!</string>'
'</resources>''
