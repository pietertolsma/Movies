#Movies
This is my first android app that will showcase the current most populair movies.

I am using themoviedb.org API to access the data that I use. To run this code, you need to add a file called "secrets.xml" to the values folder, with the following code inside:
```xml
<resources>
    <string name="api_key" type="string">YOUR API KEY HERE!</string>
</resources>
```
*How do I get the API key?*
You can register at [their website](https://www.themoviedb.org). Follow the instructions on receiving the API key and you should get one in your mailbox.

###Why I made this app
This is my very first experience on creating an android app. I am following the android udacity course, which has an assignment to create this app. Do not take this code as an example, because I will probably have made some terrible mistakes. Still cool you're checking this out though :)
