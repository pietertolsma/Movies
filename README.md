#Movies
This is my first android app that will showcase the current most populair movies.

I am using themoviedb.org API to access the data that I use. To run this code, you need to add a file called "secrets.xml" to the values folder, with the following code inside:
'''
<resources>
    <string name="api_key" type="string">00193f816285117d1164bd9d997e8743</string>
</resources>
